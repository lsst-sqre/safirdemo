# This Dockerfile has four stages:
#
# base-image
#   Updates the base Python image with security patches and common system
#   packages. This image becomes the base of all other images.
# dependencies-image
#   Installs third-party dependencies (requirements/main.txt) into a virtual
#   environment. This virtual environment is ideal for copying across build
#   stages.
# install-image
#   Installs the app into the virtual environment.
# runtime-image
#   - Copies the virtual environment into place.
#   - Runs a non-root user.
#   - Sets up the entrypoint and port.
