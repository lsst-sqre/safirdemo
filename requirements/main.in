# yarl requires typing-extensions for Python versions older than 3.8, but
# if dependencies are regenerated on Python 3.8, this dependency won't be
# pinned, causing the Docker build to fail.  While we still support 3.7,
# work around this bug by adding an unnecessary dependency on
# typing-extensions to ensure that it is hash-pinned.  When Python 3.7
# support is dropped, this hack can be removed.
